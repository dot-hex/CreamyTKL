If you'd like to compile from source, the source can be found [here](https://github.com/dot-hex/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ctkl).


The Creamy TKL, or Creamy AB.TK, is a PCB designed (as far as I understand) and distributed by Reddit/Geekhack user niceandcreamy as part of their keyboard build service, which was run under the name keyboard.care up until late 2018 (or so it appears). This repo contains the via hex file and json for this keyboard. However, since the PCB I have is built for a TX-84, I did not complete the pin wiring for the gui keys and the menu key. I also did not complete the pin wiring map for the keys below the nav cluster nor the extra breakaway portion to the right of the nav cluster. I do now have the original version of the firmware, with the full map. I plan on adding the functionality for the full board at some point in the future. 

In order to have VIA detect your pcb once it has been flashed, you will need to add the json for this keyboard in the Design tab.
